Second Microbit Workshop - National Coding Week 20/9/2019 

Objective :  
- Create a moving sprite and flashing animation (Completed in last microbit workshop) 
- Idea for personal project: Create snake game 

- Look up game documentation guide on microbit and sprite draw sprites 
- Created sprite for snake

- Realised that microbit can only create movable sprite of 1x1 dot only. Project direction change: Apple Drop game. Score by picking up randomly spawned apple from the top. Life -1 when player fail to pick up apple before it reaches the ground. 
Game over when life is 0. 

- Programmed player controls. 
- Programmed player score +1 when picked up apple. Player life -1 when apple hit the ground. Apple randomly spawn when there's no apple on the screen. 

Ideas: 
* Apple drop rate increase along time 
* Shake to pause game
